Before you start, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/justynalem/zonifero.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```sh

```

### Development

To start the development server, run:

```sh
npm run dev
```
